# Cribnotes

To some non-open book exams students can still bring a single sheet of paper.
Some students try their best to write in tiny handwriting so as to cram as much information as possible on a single sheet of paper.
Others print the notes out in a very small font.

With Cribnotes you can select the fontsize you want and cram as much 'pretty' latex-generated text onto a single piece of paper.
